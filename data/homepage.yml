  content : "Desktop Linux users have a healthy appetite for new software. Linux app stores and repositories lack software compared to the proprietary counterparts. Technical enthusiasts should direct their passion and creativity to creating fresh applications for Linux users. Too often they fall into the trap of creating more Linux distributions. We don't need more Linux distributions. Stop making Linux distributions, make applications instead."

  content : "Making new Linux distributions is fun, technically challenging and personally rewarding. 
            In general though it doesn't move the needle on getting new desktop users onto away from proprietary platforms.
            

            By all means make new distributions and spins, but consider keeping them to yourself.
            Use your technical enthusiasm to build new applications rather than yet another distro.


            There are enough Linux distributions now, the world doesn't really need more.
            We can always do with new applications."
