            lack applications compared to their proprietary counterparts. 
          

            Technical enthusiasts are encouraged to direct their passion and creativity towards creating fresh apps for Linux users. 


            Too often they fall into the trap of creating more Linux distributions. We don't need more Linux distributions. Stop making Linux distributions, make applications instead."

  content : "Unlike other platforms, Linux is a very diverse target. There are hundreds of Linux 
            distributions, some more popular than others. Once published though, applications can generally work 
            everywhere.


            There are well documented software packaging and distribution systems which enable developers to get their 
            applications into the hands of users.


            Each developer framework and Linux distribution will have their own recommended route to users. When you're
            ready to share your creation, the development documentation will signpost their suggested packaging guides."
